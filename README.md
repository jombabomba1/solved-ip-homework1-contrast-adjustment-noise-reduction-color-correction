<br>
Your first task is to enhance the supplied images using techniques of contrast adjustment, noise reduction, color correction, and so on. There are 6 images supplied (5 regular photos, and one CT). They might not need the same kind of processing. As a result, you should write your processing techniques as modules so that you can try different combinations or parameters for different images. Try to do your best.

Note: For the CT image, you can only do noise reduction. No contrast or color adjustments here.

You can use either MATLAB, C/C++, or Python 3.x for the project.

Regarding the restriction on toolbox/library usage:

You CAN use toolbox/library functions for:

<ul>

 <li>Image reading, writing, and display.</li>

 <li>Color space conversion.</li>

 <li>Matrix operations not specific to images.</li>

</ul>

You CAN NOT use toolbox/library functions for:

<ul>

 <li>Image resizing.</li>

 <li>Intensity transformations.</li>

 <li>Histogram computation.</li>

 <li>Spatial filtering. (This includes functions for doing correlation, convolution, template matching, etc.) If you’re not sure about whether something can be used or not, ask the instructor.</li>

</ul>




<u>About the submission:</u>

<ul>

 <li>Submit your report (as a single PDF file) through New E3.</li>

 <li>Regarding the content of the report:</li>

</ul>

<ol>

 <li>The main text (max. 15 pages, not counting the code listing) should include the following sections:

  <ul>

   <li>Introduction / Objectives</li>

   <li>A review of the methods you have used (be concise)</li>

   <li>A explanation of the experiments you have done, and the results.</li>

   <li>Discussions: Your observations, interpretations of results, and remaining questions.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>The report should be typed single-spaced, with 12-point font size.</li>

 <li>Include the program code listing at the end of your report, starting from a new page as a separate section.</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>Do not submit files in ZIP or RAR or other compressed forms. Do not submit program codes in separate files.</li>

</ul>




<u>The grade of each project</u> is based on the following:

<ul>

 <li>The amount of effort you put in.</li>

 <li>Quality of your report (organization, clarity, completeness, depth).</li>

 <li>Quality of your outputs.</li>

 <li>Quality of your code (correctness, efficiency, clarity, documentation).</li>

</ul>




<u>Other notes:</u>

<ul>

 <li>Late submission: 10% deduction per day, up to until the submission is closed (usually one week from the due date).</li>

</ul>
